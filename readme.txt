NOTES:

1. HTML
When scripting the header tags, include the navigation and the showcase sections

2. CSS
When CSS for html,body. Adjust font-size and font-family so that is universal

3. CSS
Overflow auto is important when you have floated elements within a div container like the navbar

4. CSS
When list items are floated and inline, be sure to display:block the li's of the ul because any added padding will not be calibrated without doing so

5. CSS
Containers as a class! Use as utility

6. HTML
No container on some, if not all, of the sections!
